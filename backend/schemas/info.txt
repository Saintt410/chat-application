Broom is a nodejs web-based application with chat and vote functions. 
Users create an account, connect their NFT wallet and then can access corresponding communities to that NFT, 
but only if the owner of the collection created a community already. In that community they have the ability 
to partake in votes and their voting power is equal to the amount of NFTs from that collection they own. 
There is also a global chat in the app and a per-community chat.
